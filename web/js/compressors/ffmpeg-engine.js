// Loads @ffmpeg/ffmpeg (already on window.FFmpegWASM via the <script> tag in
// index.html) and its WebAssembly core, entirely from local files. Reused
// as a singleton so the ~30MB core is only fetched and instantiated once
// per page load, no matter how many videos/audio files get compressed.
//
// Why local files, converted to blob: URLs, instead of a CDN:
//   @ffmpeg/ffmpeg's internal worker resolves its own chunk (814.ffmpeg.js)
//   relative to wherever ffmpeg.js itself was <script src>'d from — see the
//   comment in index.html. That fixes the Worker-construction crash. The
//   core (ffmpeg-core.js/.wasm) is loaded separately, *inside* that worker,
//   via fetch(); fetch() isn't subject to the same-origin Worker
//   restriction, so it would technically work from a CDN too — but this
//   project's brief asks for local-first, dependency-free assets, so both
//   pieces are vendored under ./vendor/ and converted to blob: URLs before
//   being handed to ffmpeg.load(). Blob URLs are always treated as
//   same-origin, which sidesteps any environment where fetch() of a plain
//   relative path behaves unexpectedly (e.g. some static-file hosts).
